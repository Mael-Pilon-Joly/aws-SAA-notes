AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments to AWS cloud storage services. It provides seamless and secure integration between an organization’s on-premises IT environment and AWS’s storage infrastructure, enabling customers to leverage AWS storage services without disrupting their existing workflows. Storage Gateway supports various use cases like backup, archive, disaster recovery, cloud bursting, and data migration.

Here are the different types of AWS Storage Gateway:

1. File Gateway
Purpose: Allows on-premises applications to store files as objects in Amazon S3 using the Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB) protocols. This setup provides a seamless way to store and access files in Amazon S3 while maintaining the local file system semantics.
Features:
Supports NFS and SMB file protocols.
Files stored in the File Gateway are stored as objects in Amazon S3.
Provides low-latency access to data with local caching.
Ideal for backup and archiving files, disaster recovery, and content distribution.
2. Volume Gateway
Volume Gateway presents cloud-based iSCSI block storage volumes to your on-premises applications. It offers two modes:

Cached Volumes:
Keeps a cache of the most frequently accessed data on-premises, reducing latency while storing the full dataset in the cloud.
Provides fast access to frequently accessed data while minimizing the on-premises storage footprint.
Stored Volumes:
Stores the entire dataset on-premises and asynchronously backs up point-in-time snapshots of these volumes to Amazon S3.
Provides local storage for complete datasets while also ensuring cloud backup for disaster recovery purposes.
3. Tape Gateway
Purpose: Enables customers to leverage their existing tape-based workflows and software to store data on virtual tapes in AWS. It is designed for backup and archiving use cases where data needs to be stored on tapes.
Features:
Provides a virtual tape library (VTL) interface, which allows existing backup applications to work with cloud storage as if they were working with physical tapes.
Virtual tapes can be stored in Amazon S3, and archived tapes are stored in Amazon S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
Eliminates the operational burden of managing physical tape infrastructure.
Use Cases
Backup and Archiving: Tape Gateway is ideal for organizations with existing tape-based workflows, while File and Volume Gateways are suitable for general file and block-level backups.
Disaster Recovery: Volume Gateway provides a robust solution for data replication and recovery in case of site failures.
Cloud Bursting: File Gateway can enable hybrid cloud architectures, allowing applications to seamlessly access cloud storage.
Data Migration: All types of Storage Gateways can be used to migrate data to AWS, facilitating data center shutdowns or hybrid cloud setups.
Benefits
Seamless Integration: Allows for easy integration with existing on-premises applications and workflows.
Scalability: Provides the ability to scale storage as needed without significant upfront costs.
Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for on-premises storage infrastructure, leading to cost savings.
Data Durability and Security: Leverages AWS’s robust storage services, ensuring data is stored securely and durably in the cloud.
In summary, AWS Storage Gateway provides versatile and flexible solutions for integrating on-premises storage with the AWS cloud, catering to various needs, from backup and archiving to disaster recovery and data migration.
