WS Systems Manager offers both a user interface (UI) and API access, providing flexibility in how you manage and automate your AWS infrastructure:

User Interface (UI)
AWS Management Console: You can use the AWS Management Console to interact with Systems Manager. This web-based interface allows you to manage resources, create and run automation scripts, view inventory, and set up compliance rules. It is a convenient option for those who prefer a graphical interface.
Code and APIs
AWS SDKs and CLI: AWS provides SDKs for various programming languages (like Python, Java, .NET, Node.js, etc.) and a Command Line Interface (CLI). These tools allow you to write scripts or programs to interact with Systems Manager, enabling you to automate tasks programmatically. This is useful for integrating Systems Manager functionality into your applications or custom workflows.
