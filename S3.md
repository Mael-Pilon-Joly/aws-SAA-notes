# Storage cost

You pay for all bandwidth into and out of Amazon S3, except for the following:

- Data transferred in from the Internet.

- Data transferred out to an Amazon EC2 instance, when the instance is in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket (including to a different account in the same AWS region).

- Data transferred out to Amazon CloudFront.

# Glacier

Amazon S3 Glacier and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive are low-cost storage classes designed for long-term data archiving and backup. They are part of the Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) ecosystem but are optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and needs to be retained for extended periods.

Amazon S3 Glacier
Amazon S3 Glacier is a low-cost cloud storage service for data archiving and long-term backup. It is ideal for data that you access infrequently but need to retain for compliance, regulatory, or other reasons. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Features and Characteristics
Cost-Effective Storage: Glacier offers low storage costs compared to standard S3 storage classes. It is designed to be a cost-effective solution for data that is rarely accessed.

Retrieval Times: Data retrieval from Glacier can take a few hours. You have several retrieval options:

Expedited: Typically in minutes, but incurs additional costs.
Standard: Usually takes 3-5 hours.
Bulk: Takes 5-12 hours, suitable for retrieving large amounts of data at lower costs.
Data Durability: Glacier provides the same high durability as S3, with 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability over a given year.

Data Encryption: Glacier supports server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or S3-managed keys to secure your data.

Lifecycle Management: You can automatically transition objects to Glacier based on S3 lifecycle policies. For example, you might move objects to Glacier after 30 days in S3 Standard.

Compliance: Glacier supports compliance requirements for data retention and archival, making it suitable for industries with strict data retention policies.

Use Cases
Data Archival: Long-term storage for compliance and historical records.
Backup Storage: Infrequent backup data retrieval.
Disaster Recovery: Storing backup copies that are rarely accessed.
Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest-cost storage class designed for data that is rarely accessed and needs to be retained for long periods, often for several decades.

Features and Characteristics
Lowest Cost: Glacier Deep Archive offers the lowest storage cost compared to other S3 storage classes, making it ideal for long-term archival.

Retrieval Times: Retrieval options are similar to Glacier but at a lower cost:

Standard: Typically takes 12 hours.
Bulk: Takes 48 hours, suitable for large-scale data retrieval at a lower cost.
Data Durability: Provides the same durability as S3 Glacier, with 11 9's durability.

Data Encryption: Like Glacier, Glacier Deep Archive supports server-side encryption for data security.

Lifecycle Management: Similar to Glacier, objects can be transitioned to Glacier Deep Archive using S3 lifecycle policies.

Use Cases
Long-Term Data Storage: Data that needs to be retained for decades but is rarely accessed.
Regulatory Compliance: For industries that require long-term archival of data for compliance purposes.

Amazon S3 Glacier Vault

Amazon S3 Glacier Vault is a container for storing archives in the S3 Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. Here’s how it works:

Features and Characteristics
Vaults: Vaults are used to organize and manage archives in Glacier. Each vault can store multiple archives, and you can create multiple vaults within an AWS account.

Vault Access: You manage access to vaults using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles.

Vault Lock: Glacier Vault Lock allows you to enforce compliance controls by applying write-once-read-many (WORM) protections on your data. Once locked, the vault's policies cannot be changed.

Vault Inventory: You can use Vault Inventory to list the archives in your vault. This helps in managing and tracking the data stored in Glacier.

Vault Notifications: You can configure notifications for various events related to vaults, such as inventory retrieval completion or job completion.

Use Cases
Organizing Data: Grouping and managing archived data.
Compliance: Implementing compliance controls using Vault Lock.
Data Management: Tracking and managing large volumes of archived data.
Summary
Amazon S3 Glacier: Low-cost storage for infrequent access with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive: The lowest-cost storage for long-term archival with retrieval times up to 48 hours.
Amazon S3 Glacier Vault: A container for managing and organizing archives in Glacier, with features for compliance and data management.
Choosing between Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive depends on your access needs and cost considerations. Glacier is suitable for data that needs infrequent access with faster retrieval, while Glacier Deep Archive is best for data that is rarely accessed but needs to be retained for long periods at the lowest cost.
