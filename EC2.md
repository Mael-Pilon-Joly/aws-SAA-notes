# Key words

# Compute Intensive
Compute Intensive refers to tasks or applications that require substantial processing power from the CPU. These tasks involve a lot of calculations or data processing and can be described as CPU-bound. Examples include:

High-Performance Computing (HPC): Tasks that involve complex simulations or large-scale computations.
Data Analysis: Operations that involve heavy mathematical or statistical calculations.
Rendering and Encoding: Graphics rendering, video encoding, or other activities that require significant CPU power.
Compute-intensive workloads benefit from instances with high CPU performance, such as the C Series (C5, C6g) in AWS EC2.

# vCPU
vCPU stands for virtual Central Processing Unit. It represents the amount of computational power available to an instance. In a virtualized environment like AWS EC2, a vCPU is a virtual processor that is allocated to an instance.

vCPUs are shared resources: They are mapped to physical CPUs on the host machine but are allocated to virtual machines or instances.
Performance Indicator: The number of vCPUs can indicate how much parallel processing power an instance has. More vCPUs generally mean that the instance can handle more tasks or larger workloads simultaneously.
Storage vs. Memory
Storage and Memory (RAM) are two different types of resources used by computing systems:

Storage
Definition: Storage refers to the space available to save data and files persistently. It is where data is kept when a computer is powered off and accessed again when needed.

Types: In AWS EC2, storage can include:

Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Persistent block storage that can be attached to EC2 instances.
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Scalable object storage for data archiving and backup.
Instance Store: Temporary storage that is physically attached to the host machine (ephemeral storage).
Usage: Used to store operating system files, application data, and user files. It provides long-term data retention.

Memory (RAM)
Definition: Memory, or RAM (Random Access Memory), is the temporary workspace used by the CPU to store and quickly access data that is currently being processed. It is volatile, meaning data is lost when the power is turned off.

Characteristics:

Fast Access: RAM provides fast read and write access compared to storage.
Volatile: Data is not retained when the system is turned off.
Usage: Used to hold running applications and data that the CPU needs to access quickly. For example, memory holds active data in a web server, which is accessed and processed while the server is running.
