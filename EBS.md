Cost: Consider the cost associated with each volume type, balancing between performance needs and budget constraints.
Durability: For critical applications, select volume types with high durability and availability guarantees.

# Instance store (think High Throughput and Low Latency, ideal for intensive IO)

Instance store and EBS (Elastic Block Store) are two types of storage options for Amazon EC2 instances, each with distinct characteristics and use cases:

Instance Store
Overview:

Instance Store provides temporary storage that is physically attached to the host machine of your EC2 instance. It’s often referred to as "ephemeral storage" because the data persists only during the life of the instance.
Characteristics:

Temporary: Data stored in instance store volumes is lost if the instance is stopped, terminated, or fails. It is not designed for persistent storage.
Performance: Offers high I/O performance and low latency because it is directly attached to the host hardware.
Cost: Typically included in the cost of the instance and does not incur additional charges.
Use Case: Ideal for temporary data, cache, buffers, or any data that can be regenerated or is not critical to persist beyond the lifecycle of the instance. Examples include scratch space for applications, temporary logs, or intermediate processing data.
EBS (Elastic Block Store)
Overview:

EBS provides persistent block storage that remains available even if the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated. It operates independently of the instance lifecycle.
Characteristics:

Persistent: Data in EBS volumes persists beyond the life of the instance. You can detach and reattach EBS volumes to different instances.
Performance: Offers various performance options based on volume types (e.g., SSD for high performance, HDD for throughput-oriented storage). Performance can be tuned according to the volume type and provisioning settings.
Cost: Charged separately from the EC2 instance based on the volume size, type, and I/O operations.
Use Case: Suitable for applications requiring durable storage, such as databases, file systems, or any data that must be preserved beyond the lifecycle of an instance.
Key Differences
Persistence:

Instance Store: Data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.
EBS: Data persists independently of the instance's lifecycle.
Performance:

Instance Store: Typically offers higher performance due to direct attachment to the host machine.
EBS: Performance varies by volume type (e.g., provisioned IOPS SSD vs. general purpose SSD). Can be tuned but may have slightly higher latency compared to instance store.
Cost:

Instance Store: Included in the cost of the instance; no separate charges for storage.
EBS: Charged based on volume size, type, and IOPS provisioned.
Use Cases:

Instance Store: Best for temporary data and high-performance requirements where data loss is acceptable.
EBS: Best for applications needing persistent and reliable storage.
When to Use Each
Instance Store: Use for temporary data or caching where high performance is needed, and data loss is acceptable.
EBS: Use for critical data that needs to be persistent, such as databases, application data, and logs that must survive instance restarts or terminations.

# RAID

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) can be configured with different RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) options, similar to traditional servers. It highlights the following points:

RAID Configuration with Amazon EBS: EBS volumes can be configured in various RAID setups to enhance performance or reliability, depending on the needs of the application. RAID configurations are implemented at the software level and need to be supported by the operating system on the instance.

EBS Data Replication: EBS volumes are replicated across multiple servers within an Availability Zone, making them more reliable than typical hard drives and less susceptible to data loss from hardware failures.

RAID 0: This configuration is suggested for applications requiring high I/O performance. It distributes I/O operations across multiple volumes, which can increase the throughput and input/output operations per second (IOPS). However, it also increases the risk of data loss since the failure of any volume results in a complete loss of the RAID array.

RAID 5 and RAID 6: These configurations are not recommended with Amazon EBS due to the performance overhead of parity calculations, which can reduce usable IOPS by 20-30%. They are also more costly compared to RAID 0 for the same performance.

RAID 1: Also not recommended for EBS, as it requires more bandwidth between Amazon EC2 and EBS, and does not improve write performance.

Creating RAID 0 Arrays: The article provides guidance on creating RAID 0 arrays, including considerations for volume size and IOPS, ensuring consistency in the volumes' size and performance, and avoiding booting from a RAID volume.

Snapshots of RAID Arrays: To back up data in a RAID configuration, multi-volume snapshots are recommended. This approach ensures snapshots are consistent across all volumes in the RAID array, preventing data integrity issues during restoration.

# Storage performance

Storage performance refers to how effectively a storage system can read and write data, and it typically includes several key metrics and characteristics:

Key Metrics
IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):

Definition: Measures the number of read and write operations that can be performed per second.
Significance: Higher IOPS indicates better performance for workloads that require frequent, small read/write operations, such as databases.

Throughput:

Definition: Measures the amount of data that can be transferred per unit of time, usually in MB/s (megabytes per second) or GB/s (gigabytes per second).
Significance: Higher throughput is important for workloads that handle large files or streams of data, such as data analytics and big data processing.

Latency:

Definition: Measures the time taken to complete a single read or write operation, often measured in milliseconds (ms).
Significance: Lower latency indicates faster response times and is crucial for applications requiring real-time data access, such as gaming or high-frequency trading.

IO Size:

Definition: Refers to the size of individual read/write operations, such as small random I/O vs. large sequential I/O.
Significance: Performance can vary based on whether the workload involves small, random I/O operations or large, sequential operations.
Types of Storage Performance

Block Storage:

Characteristics: Provides raw storage volumes that can be formatted with a filesystem. Performance is often characterized by IOPS, throughput, and latency.
Examples: Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store), traditional hard drives and SSDs.

File Storage:

Characteristics: Provides file-level access to data, often optimized for large-scale data access.
Examples: Network Attached Storage (NAS), Amazon EFS (Elastic File System).
Object Storage:

Characteristics: Provides storage of data as objects with metadata, suitable for large-scale, unstructured data.
Examples: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), Google Cloud Storage.

Factors Affecting Storage Performance
Storage Type:

SSD vs. HDD: SSDs typically offer higher IOPS and lower latency compared to HDDs.
Provisioned vs. Shared: Provisioned storage provides dedicated performance, while shared storage might have variable performance depending on demand.

Volume Size and Configuration:

Capacity: Larger volumes may offer better performance in certain configurations.
RAID Configurations: RAID levels can affect performance, such as RAID 0 for increased performance and RAID 5 for balance between performance and redundancy.

Instance Type and Configuration:

EC2 Instances: Different instance types offer varying levels of storage performance.
Provisioned IOPS: For some storage types, like EBS, you can provision specific levels of IOPS.
Workload Characteristics:

Read vs. Write Operations: Different workloads (e.g., read-heavy vs. write-heavy) can impact performance.
Data Access Patterns: Sequential vs. random access patterns can affect performance metrics.

# I/O characteristics and monitoring

1Gib volume = 50 IOPS

The volume queue length is the number of pending I/O requests for a device. Latency is the true end-to-end client time of an I/O operation, in other words, the time elapsed between sending an I/O to EBS and receiving an acknowledgment from EBS that the I/O read or write is complete. Queue length must be correctly calibrated with I/O size and latency to avoid creating bottlenecks either on the guest operating system or on the network link to EBS.

# Snapshots

EBS snapshots are incremental backups of your Amazon EBS volumes. They capture the state of an EBS volume at a specific point in time. Snapshots can be used to create new volumes or restore existing ones, and they are stored in Amazon S3, providing durability and reliability.

Key Features
Incremental Backups: EBS snapshots are incremental. After the initial snapshot, only the changes made since the last snapshot are saved. This helps in reducing the storage costs and the time required for subsequent snapshots.

Durability and Availability: Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3, benefiting from its high durability and availability. S3 stores data across multiple facilities and ensures that your snapshots are highly durable.

Point-in-Time Recovery: Snapshots allow you to recover your EBS volumes to a specific point in time. This can be crucial for recovering from data corruption, accidental deletion, or other issues.

Cross-Region and Cross-Account Copying: You can copy snapshots across regions or AWS accounts. This feature is useful for disaster recovery, data migration, or sharing data between different AWS accounts.

Cost Efficiency: Since snapshots are incremental, they are more cost-effective compared to full backups. You only pay for the storage you use, and costs are generally lower for subsequent snapshots.

Integration with AWS Services: EBS snapshots integrate with other AWS services such as Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) for automated snapshot management, AWS Backup for centralized backup management, and AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code.

How EBS Snapshots Work
Creating a Snapshot: When you create a snapshot, EBS captures the entire volume state, including the data and metadata. The first snapshot is a full backup, while subsequent snapshots only include changes made since the last snapshot.

Restoring a Volume: To restore from a snapshot, you create a new EBS volume from the snapshot. This volume is an exact replica of the state of the volume at the time of the snapshot. You can then attach this volume to an EC2 instance.

Deleting Snapshots: When you delete a snapshot, it removes the data related to that snapshot from Amazon S3. However, it does not affect the data of other snapshots or volumes that might still depend on it.

Use Cases
Backup and Recovery: Regularly create snapshots to back up data and enable quick recovery in case of failures or accidental data loss.

Data Migration: Use snapshots to migrate data between regions or accounts, making it easier to move or share data.

Volume Cloning: Create new EBS volumes from snapshots to duplicate data for testing, development, or scaling purposes.

Disaster Recovery: Store snapshots in different regions to ensure data is available in case of a regional failure.

Best Practices
Automate Snapshots: Use AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) or AWS Backup to automate the creation and deletion of snapshots according to your backup policies.

Monitor Snapshot Usage: Regularly monitor your snapshot usage and costs using AWS Cost Explorer or CloudWatch to manage storage efficiently.

Test Restores: Periodically test restoring from snapshots to ensure that your backups are reliable and that you can recover data as expected.

Encrypt Snapshots: Consider using EBS encryption to secure your data at rest. Snapshots created from encrypted volumes are also encrypted.

Clean Up Old Snapshots: Regularly review and delete old or unnecessary snapshots to manage costs and storage.

Conclusion
EBS snapshots are a powerful and cost-effective way to back up, recover, and manage data stored on Amazon EBS volumes. Their incremental nature, durability, and integration with other AWS services make them an essential tool for data protection and management in AWS environments.


# EBS Volume Usage During Snapshot Creation
Non-Disruptive Operation: When you initiate a snapshot of an EBS volume, the snapshot operation is performed in the background. The volume remains fully operational, and you can continue to read from and write to the volume as usual.

Consistency: To ensure data consistency, EBS snapshots are designed to capture a consistent view of the volume. When the snapshot starts, EBS uses a technique called “snapshots with copy-on-write”:

Initial Snapshot: The first snapshot of a volume creates a full backup. This initial snapshot captures the complete state of the volume at the time the snapshot begins.
Subsequent Snapshots: After the initial snapshot, only changes made since the last snapshot are recorded. This incremental approach ensures that the snapshot is efficient and fast.
Snapshot Process:

Copy-on-Write: During the snapshot process, any changes to the volume data are written to new locations on the volume, while the snapshot captures the data as it was at the start of the snapshot.
Snapshot Metadata: The snapshot process creates metadata that represents the state of the volume at the beginning of the snapshot, ensuring consistency even if data changes during the snapshot creation.
Performance Impact: While snapshots are generally non-disruptive, there may be a slight performance impact on the volume during snapshot creation, particularly if the volume is under heavy I/O load. This impact is typically minimal and often not noticeable for most applications.

Best Practices for Snapshot Management
Plan Snapshots During Off-Peak Hours: To minimize any potential performance impact, consider scheduling snapshot operations during periods of lower activity or off-peak hours if possible.

Monitor Performance: Use AWS CloudWatch metrics to monitor the performance of your EBS volumes and ensure that snapshot operations do not adversely affect your applications.

Automate Snapshot Creation: Utilize AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) or AWS Backup to automate the creation and management of snapshots, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent backup practices.

Test Snapshot Restores: Regularly test restoring from snapshots to verify the integrity and reliability of your backups.

# Encryption

Overview of Amazon EBS Encryption

Simplified Encryption: Amazon EBS provides straightforward encryption for EBS resources without requiring you to manage your own key management infrastructure.

AWS KMS Integration: Encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys for creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.

Data Protection: Ensures security for data at rest and data in transit between EC2 instances and EBS volumes.

Flexibility: Allows attaching both encrypted and unencrypted volumes to an EC2 instance simultaneously.
How EBS Encryption Works
Comprehensive Coverage: Encrypts boot and data volumes, data at rest, data in transit, snapshots, and volumes from snapshots.

AES-256 Encryption: Uses AES-256 encryption standard, with data keys generated and encrypted by AWS KMS.

Data Key Reuse: Volumes and snapshots share the same data key if encrypted with the same KMS key.

Encryption with Snapshots

Encrypted Snapshots: If the snapshot is encrypted, EC2 uses AWS KMS to handle encryption and decryption, either reusing the snapshot’s data key or generating a new one if a different KMS key is used.

Unencrypted Snapshots: When encrypting a volume from an unencrypted snapshot, EC2 requests new data keys and uses them for encryption.

Key Management and Effects of Unusable Keys

Usability: EBS volumes use data keys for encryption; thus, the immediate effect of making a KMS key unusable is minimal.

Detachment Impact: When an encrypted volume is detached, the data key is removed from memory. 

Reattachment requires decryption using the original KMS key, which must be functional.

Encrypting EBS Resources

Encryption Options: Encryption can be enabled by default or specified during volume creation, using a chosen symmetric KMS key.

Immutable Encryption: Once a volume or snapshot is encrypted, it remains encrypted, and encryption cannot be removed.

Sharing and Copying: Public snapshots of encrypted volumes are unsupported, but encrypted snapshots can be shared with specific accounts. Encryption can be applied during snapshot copying or AMI launch.

Key Rotation

Best Practices: Key rotation is recommended for security, either by using new customer-managed keys or enabling automatic key rotation.

Automatic Rotation: AWS KMS generates new cryptographic material annually, retaining previous versions for decryption purposes.

Overall, Amazon EBS encryption offers robust security for data on EC2 instances by leveraging AWS KMS for key management, supporting encryption for a range of scenarios, and facilitating best practices for cryptographic key management.
