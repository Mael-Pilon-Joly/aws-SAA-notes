AWS DataSync is a managed service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems, AWS Storage services, and among AWS Storage services themselves. It supports both file and object storage, allowing you to efficiently migrate data to the cloud.

AWS DataSync is preferred over Storage Gateway when you need:

High-Speed Data Transfer: DataSync uses a purpose-built network protocol to accelerate data transfers.
One-Time or Periodic Transfers: Ideal for initial bulk transfers or periodic synchronizations.
Automation and Management: It automates and simplifies the process of moving data at scale, including scheduling and monitoring.
